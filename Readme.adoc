:description: Documentation to describe how to use this project.
:doctitle: README.adoc

This is a text document formatted in the `asciidoctor` style of syntax. 

== Purpose 

*index.html* is a website landing page for this project. 

''''

== Build Tool

This project is designed to use the *Gradle* build tool. So the folder structure reflects the build tool expectations.


There is also a tiny wrapper of tools that allow you to build and run *gradle* without installing that tool. As a trial to confirm everything is correctly
installed, open a terminal command session. Then change directories in the root of this project. Then try a command like:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew check
----

''''

NOTE: An active internet session is optional as is a java runtime environment of JDK7 or more recent.

''''

First time execution (only) will force *Gradle* to download several dependencies from the internet. This is to support build script logic and speed things up after the first run.

''''

== Provided Scripts
  
A build script is included and has the .gradle file suffix. Their name and purpose are :

 . *build.gradle* - primary tasks needed to build this project

.Typical Execution Sequence 
[source,bash]
---- 
 gradlew check
 gradlew -b build.gradle 
----

''''

NOTE: In fact, you do not need gradle, this project structure, wrapper or any other pieces. Only the folders and files within these folders form the `index.html` landing page.
